# Stock Return Project

![stock Market](Images/stockmarket.jpg)

## Background

The purpose of this project was to use VBA scripting to analyze real stock market data. 

I created a script which looped through multiple worksheets for all stocks provided over a one year period and captured

  * The ticker symbol.

  * The yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

  * The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

  * The total stock volume of the stock.

Additionally, I then added conditional formatting to highlight the positive changes in green and the negative changes in red.

I then provided further analysis by returning the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease" and "Greatest total volume".
